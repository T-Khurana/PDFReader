## Functionality

The application supports the following functionality. 
* **Navigation-** The application allows you to navigate forwards and backwards through the pages of the document using the buttons. The status bar on the bottom of the page indicates the page number. 
* **Pencil-** The application allows the user to write notes or draw on the page. 
* **Highlighter-** The application allows the user to draw over text using a thick, transparent yellow brush that allows the user to highlight text. 
* **Eraser-** The eraser tool allows the user to erase to erase pencil or highlighter marks. 
* **Pan and Zoom-** The user can use two fingers to zoom in and out. When zoomed in, the user is able to pan and reposition the document. This functionality is the same as a Google Maps user interface. 
* **Undo and Redo-** The buttons on the top of the document allow the user to undo the last 10 changes in the document. User is also allowed to revert the undo using the redo button. 
* The app is also able to handle changes to orientation, and thus it is usable in both portrait or landscape mode. 
* The app also allows the user to make changes, exit the application, and then reload the application to have their changes intact. Markings remain when navigating through pages, too.
